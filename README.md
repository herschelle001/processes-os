This repo contains source code of Exercise 1.1 (See problem statement)

To run the code simply change the current directory to src directory (or where the code is present) in my case it will be
cd herschelle001/simple-command-line/src

Then type in the cmd line
make

This will compile the code and binaries of the files will be generated. Finally type
./a.out
